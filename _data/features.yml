# The features content is currently in index.md
# If you are planning to replace anything in index.md with a gridblock or something...
#    e.g., {% include content/gridblocks.html data_source=site.data.features imagealign="bottom"%}
# .... then you can add items in here like:
#
#- title: Feature
#  text: |
#        Feature desc.
#  image: images/optional-image.png
