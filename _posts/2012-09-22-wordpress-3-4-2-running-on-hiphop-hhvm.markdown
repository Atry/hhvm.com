Welcome to the inaugural post on the HipHop for PHP blog. Â In the coming days, weeks, months, and (dare I predict) years, we'll be creating posts about the inner workings of HipHop, the practical implementation details of running it, and whatever else manages to fit on this site.

So sit back, add us to your RSS reader, and enjoy.
