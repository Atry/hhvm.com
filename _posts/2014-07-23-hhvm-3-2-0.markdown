The [next version of HHVM](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Prebuilt%20Packages%20for%20HHVM) is out (well it came out 6 days ago, I've just been at [OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/34640) all week and haven't had a chance to do this post).

<!--truncate-->

Some of the highlights:


  * The other 100 bugfixes from [our last lockdown](http://hhvm.com/blog/5195/hhvm-3-1-0).


  * `hh_client` and `hh_server` now build on OSX and don't need .hhi files.


  * fastcgi params are now in `$_SERVER`.


  * `$php_errormsg` works.


  * `PHP_VERSION` now is 5.6.


Security Fixes:


  * [CVE-2010-3065](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3065): PHP Session Serializer Session Data Injection Vulnerability


  * [CVE-2013-3735](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-3735): Segfault on memory exhaustion within function definition


  * [CVE-2006-7243](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-7243): NULL byte poisoning fix
