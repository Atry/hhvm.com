Two big announcements back to back.

[Box announced](http://tech.blog.box.com/2014/11/box-on-hhvm/) that they did their cutover to HHVM yesterday seeing their latency drop by **3x**. I did a [Q & A about HHVM](https://tech.blog.box.com/2014/11/hhvm-q-and-a/) today.

The wordpress hosting site [wp-engine announced](http://wpengine.com/2014/11/19/hhvm-project-mercury/) their support for HHVM today seeing a **5.6x** speedup on their bbPress app, and **3.9x** on their custom wordpress installs.

One of the main reasons I put so much time into HHVM is for these kinds of stories. I'm very proud of how far we've come and where we're going.
