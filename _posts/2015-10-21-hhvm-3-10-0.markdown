HHVM 3.10.0 is out! You can [get it from the usual places](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Prebuilt-Packages-for-HHVM). Major changes in this version include:

**Core changes**

  * Performance improvements for certain usages of `strtr()`


  * Fixes to `rand()` when requesting very large integers


  * XDebug compatibility and resource usage fixes


  * Improved reflection support


  * The usual myriad of bug fixes and general performance improvements


**Hack language**

  * Dramatically improved type inference for arrays


  * Improved typechecking for some standard library functions


  * Other minor fixes, e.g., improved type enforcement in some edge cases and fixes to using shapes inside namespaced code


As always, let us know how it goes! [File an issue on Github if you run into any issues.](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/issues)

> We already have one known issue in 3.10.0; the `strtr` performance improvement causes a crash in some cases. Version 3.10.1 will be on its way out by the time you read this, which fixes this issue.
