HHVM 4.67 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.60;
HHVM 4.61&ndash;4.66 remain supported, as do the 4.32 and 4.56 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- Server stats are now cleared after warmup, to reduce noise from requests that
  should be unrepresentative.
- Runtime type errors now consistently say `varray` or `darray` as appropriate,
  instead of just `array`.

# Breaking Changes

- An exception is now thrown when a file contains top-level code.
- HackC will no longer emit top-level code outside of the debugger.
- Backticks are no longer parsed as quotation separators; they were previously
  equivalent to double quotes.
- `(array)` casts are now disabled in the runtime.
