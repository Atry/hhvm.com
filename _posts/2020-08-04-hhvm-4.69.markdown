HHVM 4.69 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.62;
HHVM 4.63&ndash;4.68 remain supported, as do the 4.32 and 4.56 LTS releases.

# Breaking Changes

- Directly implementing the same interface twice with multiple generics is now
  banned, due to incorrect over-permissiveness.
- The `hhvm.check_return_type_hints` runtime option has been removed.
- It is now a typechecker error to attempt to directly construct an
  `IntlIterator`.
- It is now a type error to have duplicate classes, type aliases, or records
  (potential future feature) with the same name.
- `fun()` now returns a distinct type, not a string; this will not pass string
  typehints. For now, string variables are still invocable, but this will change,
  and is highly discouraged.
