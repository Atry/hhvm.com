HHVM 4.74 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.67;
HHVM 4.68&ndash;4.73 remain supported, as do the 4.32 and 4.56 LTS releases.

# Breaking Changes

- Previous versions of the typechecker checked for overridden final methods in
  two places; now this is consistently checked once in the typechecking phase,
  which can result in changed error codes.
- Single-quoted string shape keys that contain escape sequences (backslashes)
  are now handled the same way as other single-quoted strings. Previous versions
  would incorrectly include the backslash in the key.
- The typechecker now verifies method `where` constraints are well-formed;
  method generic constraints (e.g. `public function foo<T as Bar>()`) were
  already verified in this way.
