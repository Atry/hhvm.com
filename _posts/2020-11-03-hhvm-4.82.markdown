HHVM 4.82 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.76;
HHVM 4.77&ndash;4.81 remain supported, as does the 4.56 LTS release.

# Highlights

- `AsyncMysqlQueryResults` has the new method
  `dictRowsTyped(): vec<dict<string, arraykey>>`.
- Improved several typechecker error messages for incompatible method overrides,
  e.g. when an override has more mandatory arguments.

# Breaking Changes

- `array_fill_keys()` will now throw an `InvalidArgumentException` if the first
  argument is not a `Container`; in previous versions,
  HHVM would return `false`. With this change, `array_fill_keys()` now only
  returns `darray`s.
- improved correctness when type constants are accessed via inferred union or
  intersection types. This can both lead to fewer incorrect type checker errors,
  but also additional correct type checker errors.
