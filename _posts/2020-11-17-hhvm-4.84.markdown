HHVM 4.84 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.78;
HHVM 4.79&ndash;4.82 remain supported, as does the 4.56 LTS release. This
primarily contains internal improvements for performance, maintainability, and
preparation for future work.

**We will not be releasing 4.85 next week** due to US holidays; we
expect the next release to be 4.86, during the week of 2020-11-30.

# Highlights

- Fixed propagation of reified generics in `class B<T> extends A<T>` when `A`'s
  `T` parameter is reified, but `B`'s is not.

# Future Changes

- Indexing into a string with an index that is not an `arraykey` will throw an
  `InvalidArgumentException`; currently, it emits a
  `String offset cast occurred` notice.
