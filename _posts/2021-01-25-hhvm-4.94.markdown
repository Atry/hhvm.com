HHVM 4.94 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.86;
HHVM 4.87&ndash;4.93 remain supported, as do the 4.56 and 4.80 LTS releases.

Additionally, 4.88.1, 4.91.1, 4.92.1, and 4.93.1 have been released, fixing a
segmentation fault on machines with less than 8GB of RAM.

(Note: HHVM 4.89 and 4.90 were skipped.)

# Highlights

- Fixed a regression where HHVM would segfault on startup on systems with less
  than 8GB of RAM; this included most TravisCI and CircleCI configurations.
- Fixed line numbers for some runtime errors being incorrectly reported as -1.
- Fixed `debug_zval_dump()` incorrectly reporting a refcount of `1` for
  uncounted or static values; these are now explicitly marked as `uncounted` or
  `static`.
- The error message for attempting to use first class function pointer syntax
  with instance methods (as opposed to static methods) now suggests
  `meth_caller()`.
- first class function pointers are now supported by debugging functions such as
  `print_r`, `var_dump`, and `=` in hphpd.

# Breaking Changes

- Fixed a bug that led to a typechecker error not being consistently raised when
  function has a parameter with a default argument followed by another
  parameter without a default argument.
- The runtime will now throw undefined variable exceptions instead of raising a
  notice.
