HHVM 4.137 is released! HHVM 4.131&ndash;4.136 remain supported, as do the 4.102 and 4.128 LTS releases. HHVM 4.131 remains supported as the 4.132 release was cancelled.

# Highlights

- `hh_client --lint` no longer suggests that reified generic parameters should be marked as covariant or contravariant, as this is not supported for reified generic.
- IDEs now suggest replacing `self` with `static` when calling an abstract static method.
- Improved the accuracy and message clarity of the 'always false'/'always true' built in linter when a condition
  is always true/false due to `is`/`as` checks.
