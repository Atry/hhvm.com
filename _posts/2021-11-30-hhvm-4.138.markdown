HHVM 4.138 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.131; HHVM 4.133&ndash;4.136 remain supported (4.132 was cancelled), as do the 4.102 and 4.128 LTS releases.

This release primarily contains changes that are not easily observable, such as
reliability improvements and preparation work for future changes.

# Highlights

- regex functions correctly handle the `/A` modifier with non-zero offsets (regression fix)
