HHVM 4.164 is released! 4.161 - 4.163 remain supported,
as do the 4.128 and 4.153 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- `hh` now rejects type aliases in `catch` blocks. These were already
  banned in the runtime
  ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/7fff3fda12e627be7fa18750677ea0f0ada8f172)).
- Fixed an issue with incremental typechecks where making an XHP
  attribute required would not always show a type error
  ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/59f6ba82d11ba1c6e0eb7867a04b96bc49581e5a))
- Introduced the `__Docs` attribute on classes
  ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/9e284df22eb12fbcb17e1dcf7e10ec632d17d607))
