HHVM 4.165 is released! 4.162 - 4.164 remain supported,
as do the 4.128 and 4.153 LTS releases.

# Dropping support for Ubuntu 18.04

This release does not compile on Ubuntu 18.04. Ubuntu 18.04 is
[outside our support
lifecycle](https://hhvm.com/blog/2019/11/19/distribution-support.html)
and this is the first HHVM version that depends on newer C++ features.

# Highlights

- `hh` now computes smaller fanouts in some circumstances (such as
  [enum
  constraints](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/05cadcc342f078bdad309a33f3734763ec1d4412)),
  making incremental typecheckers faster.
- Added Curl constants for libcurl 7.66
  ([commit](1c9949d716df58df15bbedd351e799b8d76ebc6e)).
- Major parts of systemlib now have explicit type signatures
  (e.g. [ext_datetime](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/19395f33f61da0c8916d17150f248a5631ac916e)),
  allowing the typechecker to catch more issues.
- Added lints for [unconditional
  recursion](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/5c8e50640e6860524f43813889b38958de34f7e3)
  and [all function branches returning the same
  value](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/edfd45cc057bc1b78e46665692df0316841b30ca).
