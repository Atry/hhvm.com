HHVM 4.168 (LTS) is released! This release has long term support, so:
- this release will be supported for approximately 48 weeks
- the next LTS will be released in approximately 24 weeks
- HHVM 4.153 (LTS) and HHVM 4.165&ndash;167 remain supported
- support has ended for 4.128 (LTS) and 4.164

# Status of Ubuntu 22.04 support

We had intended for this release to have Ubuntu 22.04 support, but we are
releasing without that support for now. Due to library version compatibility
issues, we need more time to get this support working, and we did not want 
to delay the release for other platforms. We intend to make a 4.168.1 
release with 22.04 support as soon as we get builds working on 22.04.

Note that our experimental universal packages (also available for version
4.168) are not affected by this issue and should be usable on any version of
Ubuntu.

# Highlights

- Fix a typechecker bug where enums that recursively include themselves were 
  not being correctly rejected.
  ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/6c95bdbe3b))
- Fix a bug where a lint could spuriously report a variable was shadowed when
  that variable was not actually shadowed due to the potentially shadowing write
  happening in the body of a lambda.
  ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/21afafcb3f))
- Ignore case and don't consider the class name when looking for 'did you
  mean' suggestions for invalid enum class labels.
  ([commit1](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/3a3a5a5bb5))
  ([commit2](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/bebe707323))
- Improve printing of unresolved types in typechecker errors; e.g.
  `Expected Awaitable<[unresolved]> But got int` becomes `Expected
  Awaitable<_> But got int`
  ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/afac86e51e))
- Improve error message when accessing a shape with a value that's not a
  literal or class constant.
  ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/c2b2433f90))
- Improve error message from linter that points out when all return 
  statements in a function return the same value.
  ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/d606fb0198)) Also make 
  this linter stop firing on functions that could plausibly be returning 
  unix exit codes.
